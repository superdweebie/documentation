Testing
=======

Unit tests are written with `phpUnit <http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/>`_, which is a requirement for running the tests.

Tests can be run from the root ``doctrine-extensions`` directory by typeing::

    phpunit

Tests coverage should always be 90% or higher.

`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_ is also integrated with the github repo. Travis CI build reports can be accessed `here <https://travis-ci.org/superdweebie/doctrineExtensions>`_.
